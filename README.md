# NoGrok

Browser extension that removes Grokipedia results from major search engines for a cleaner, source-first search experience.

## Install (unpacked)

1. Clone this repo.
2. In Chrome/Edge/Brave, open `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer Mode, and choose **Load unpacked**.
3. Select the repo folder. The extension icon opens a popup to pick how Grokipedia links are treated.

## Behavior

- Supports Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Brave Search, and Startpage.
- Filters any result linking to Grokipedia (including subdomains).
- Modes: hide results entirely, gray them out, or leave them visible.
- Popup shows how many Grokipedia results were blocked on the current page and in total.
- Uses a `MutationObserver` to keep filtering dynamically loaded results.

## TODO

- [x] Handling modes (hide/gray/keep) with pills and counter
- [x] Popup UI for mode selection and counts
- [ ] Package with icons
- [ ] Publishing to Chrome Web Store
